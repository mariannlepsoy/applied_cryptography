### Overview
Implements a message authentication code (MAC) using the HMAC construction with the SHA-256 hash function.

The task is to construct a MAC using the HMAC construction without using HMAC implementations from any library. This is to demonstrate an understanding of the HMAC construction and the SHA-256 hash function.
