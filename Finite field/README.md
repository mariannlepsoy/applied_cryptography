### Overview

This module is designed to work with the finite field F₂₆, which is constructed using the primitive polynomial p(x)= x⁶ + x + 1. The core functionality of this module is encapsulated in a function F(x, k), which operates on 6-bit blocks for both inputs and outputs. The function is defined as:

F(x, k) = x³ + (x + k)³ + k,

where x and k are 6-bit vectors representing elements of the finite field, and the operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation are carried out within the finite field.

### Implementation Details
The provided program computes F(x, k) for any given 6-bit inputs x and k. For example, input vectors of x = (0,0,0,0,0,0) and k = (0,0,0,0,0,0) will produce an output vector also consisting of six bits.

### Lookup Table Generation
Additionally, the program generates a lookup table for the function F, storing the results in a file. Each entry in the lookup table represents a pair in the form x, k -> F(x), covering all possible combinations of 6-bit inputs for x and k.
