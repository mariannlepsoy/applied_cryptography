### Overview
Implementation of a differential uniformity calculator for (n, n)-functions represented as lookup tables. The calculator is designed to compute the differential uniformity of a given function, which is a measure of its cryptographic strength.

The program `du.py` takes a lookup table as input and outputs the differential uniformity of the function.
